                    Our briquettes are made entirely 
                    from locally sourced sawdust waste and specially
                    crafted for industrial boilers.
                 </p>

                    We care about your broilers' durability and sustainability,
                    hence, we use natural binding agent for super strong briquettes.
                 </p>
                    
                 <p>
                    As no chemicals or additional additives are used, our sawdust briquettes ensure that your broilers run efficiently.
