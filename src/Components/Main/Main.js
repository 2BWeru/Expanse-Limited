                    Our briquettes are made entirely 
                    from locally sourced sawdust waste and specially
                    crafted for industrial boilers.

                    We care about your broilers' durability and sustainability,
                    hence, we use natural binding agent for super strong briquettes.
                 </p>
                    
                 <p>
                    As no chemicals or additional additives are used, our sawdust briquettes ensure that your broilers run efficiently.
